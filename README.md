https://github.com/tjboldt/Apple2-IO-RPi/tree/main/RaspberryPiPico

## What does it do?
In a nutshell it allows a small Linux server, usually a Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi Nano act as USB boot image server and file storage for the Apple II. In addition it allows the the Apple II to take advantage of the Raspberry Pi/Linux server via BASIC extensions. i.e -rpi.command and -shell. It also can behave as a time source for your Apple II.

## What is needed?
 - Apple II+ or Apple IIe
 - Small Linux host, i.e. RPi Nano
 - A2Pico
 - USB DC block adapter. Needed if you intend to power the Linux host independently.
 - OTG USB micro adapter to USB-A female
 - Micro SDHC card.
